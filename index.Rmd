# Project Overview
A feasibility assessment study has been conducted to determine whether indirect treatment comparisons (ITC) between COVID-19 vaccines is feasible. The findings indicated that differences in key treatment effect modifiers between trials largely precluded valid analyses. However, despite the recommendations to not perform such analyses, there have been several recent publications comparing COVID-19 Vaccines.

This project aimed to meet the following objectives:
 - To systematically identify all published literature assessing the feasibility of or reporting ITC results between COVID-19 Vaccines.
 - To critically appraise the identified studies.
 - To compare and contrast our own feasibility assessment findings/recommendations with other published ITCs.

## SLR Results
The SLR included 11 ITCs of COVID-19 vaccines.
